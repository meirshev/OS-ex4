REMARKS:

DESIGN:
we implemnted a block class that contains all the data,
cache manager that manages all the cache,
a log file that is the BB.
we implemented the algorithm of the cache that uses also 
the lfu and also the lru.

ANSWERS:

1)
yes, in our case, our heap is stored on the computer ram, that is
faster than the really disk.

2)
in this case we dont have a deterministic answer, its depends on 
who take manages the cache (os or hardware) and what is the size of
the cache.
as the algorithm becomes more sophisticated the hardware will be 
more sopisticated and its not good.
and according to the size, each algorithm have different performance 
according to his size.

3)
an example that lru is good and lfu isnt:
when a block is called a lot of time in a short period of times.
in this case, when the period is finished, the lfu block is still 
will be there (take place)
both arent solve the problem:
if we use unformly in memory amount that is bigger from our cache,
than they both will free the memory.
an example that lfu is good and lru isnt:
if every constant time a block is called, but the period is pretty 
long, so the lru will not be good, and the lfu will.

4)
the issue is that every new block will inserted to the cache, specieallly 
in case that it used in a short period of time, and than will be "stack" 
in the chach for vain
